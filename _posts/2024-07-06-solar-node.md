## Check out this video from The Comms Channel
Rokland now sells a solar enclosure for WisBlock nodes from RAK, with a bigger solar panel and space for your WisBlock board and a flat LiPo battery, and supports several mounting options. This might be a good place to start if you are looking to make a solar powered node without too much construction or hassle. You can look at this enclosure [here.](https://store.rokland.com/products/rak-wireless-solar-unify-enclosure-ip67-150x100x45mm-pre-mounted-m8-5-pin-rp-sma-connector-pid-910421?ref=tc2)
