## Hi!
The site had been updated with a new guides tab in the side bar, where you will find all guides written by Angelo Mesh regarding radio setup and configuration, as well as build guides and positioning. I have published a getting started guide for new meshtastic users that I think most will find helpful for setting up new radios. I will be working on many more guides soon this month! You can access this guide [here.](/guides/getting-started) Stay tuned for more!
